# Koibird 🧑🏼‍💻🥤
[Scratch Koibird Website](https://ybogdanq.github.io/Koibird/) 
Koibird website created as a test task for `Crisp Studio`.

## Description
This github project has 2 branches
1. Main - main branch where hosting files served.
2. Dev - dev branch where development files served.

Whole project was built in pure html and js! 
And a lil bit of SCSS and Gulp.

I hope I did well. If you found an issue just let me know to fix it 🙂.
